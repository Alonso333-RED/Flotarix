# Flotarix
Flotarix is a turn-based board game where players build and command their own space fleets, making tactical decisions through movement and positioning to outsmart and destroy opposing fleets. Each ship has its own playstyle, strengths, and weaknesses, adding depth, strategy, and replayability. Built mainly in Python using the Arcade library.
